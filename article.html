                    While oats have made it to our breakfast tables in no time due to their specific benefits for our
                    bodies, there is still something that you might have missed out on when it comes to oats. I am
                    talking about colloidal oatmeal! Has dry, itchy skin shaken your faith? Now, you do not need to give
                    up on your dry, itchy skin, just not yet. Colloidal oatmeal might prove to be the ingredient that
                    shoos away your discomfort.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although the ingredient might sound familiar, chances are you are as much in the dark about
                    colloidal oatmeal as someone who has not heard of it. If you have been treating your dry, flaky,
                    itchy skin for some time, your products will likely contain this superfood ingredient. Colloidal
                    oatmeal is loaded with nutrients(but obvious), lipids, saponins, and antioxidants, and this makes
                    colloidal oatmeal a protector, soother, nourisher, cleanser, and moisturizer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Colloidal oatmeal has been around for centuries relieving itching and irritation. The soothing
                    superfood has some real skin-treating powers. It not only soothes dry skin by locking in moisture
                    but also forms a protective film on your skin when combined with water or oil.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Formed from very wholesome grain, oats, colloidal oatmeal has been effectively helpful with eczema
                    and other dry, sensitive skin conditions by forming a barrier when your skin is unable to do so. The
                    ingredient is worth treasuring since it also

                    by soaking up the extra oil, and the saponins in oats exfoliate your skin gently.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The instant beauty staple is everything you ever needed to relieve that itch, but hold on. Take a
                    step back and know the essentials before stocking up on this. &nbsp;

                <h2>So what is colloidal oatmeal? </h2>

                <p>
                    If you are a fitness geek, you come across this skincare ingredient every day! Since Colloidal
                    oatmeal is essentially ground oatmeal, Avena Sativa (scientific and fancy). It has to go through a
                    process to be effective on your skin and work. The ground oats are placed in a liquid to be applied
                    easily and absorbed by the skin. Finely-ground oat has fats, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and other
                    nutrients that make colloidal oatmeal a moisturizer, an emollient, to be more specific. They all
                    come together to soothe, moisturize and protect your skin. The skin softener has antioxidants that
                    make it an FDA-approved skin protectant.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You cannot mill the bowl of oats you took out to eat in your breakfast because they differ from
                    colloidal oatmeal in the sense that colloidal oatmeal has a cosmetic essence to it. After all, it is
                    processed with whole bran. The bran has actives that soothe the skin, and that's what makes
                    colloidal oatmeal valuable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The mega-star ingredient in skincare is available in various forms, from powders to moisturizers and
                    from gels to shampoos.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <h2>How exactly does colloidal oatmeal help your skin?
                </h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                We referred to the actives of oil-replenishing lipids, beta-glucans that moisturize, antioxidants -
                avenanthramides, the antioxidant and
                <a href="https://beminimalist.co/collections/all/anti-inflammatory" style="color: rgb(129,216,208);"
                    target="_top">anti-inflammatory</a>
                plant chemicals unique to oatmeal that boosts your skin's health.
                <br>
                <br>
                Avenanthramides diminish cytokines (proteins that cause inflammation). This makes oatmeal a potential
                fighter against inflammation and itching. The presence of antioxidants also means that the ingredient
                also fights free radicals in your skin and
                <a href="https://beminimalist.co/blogs/skin-care/how-to-get-rid-of-wrinkles-methods-recommended-by-dermatologists"
                    style="color: rgb(129,216,208);" target="_top">prevents wrinkles</a>
                . The result? A smooth and supple skin.
                <br>
                <br>
                Colloidal oatmeal has been an active participant in the fight against eczema for a while now. The itchy,
                scaly skin that eczema or dermatitis leads to can be healed with colloidal oatmeal in various ways, with
                baths or moisturizers that contain the ingredient.
                <br>
                <br>
                Radiation treatments for cancer often lead to skin irritation and dryness, so calming the skin down
                colloidal oatmeal proves to be quite effective.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I said, it calms the itch for you, soothes and moisturizes the area to make your life easy and your
                skin smooth.
                <br>
                Now that itch can be due to a skin condition like psoriasis, dermatitis, xerosis(severely dry skin),
                chickenpox, or some wounds, burns, and bites. Studies also point out that xerosis-affected skin
                benefited greatly from the ingredient and has significantly improved moisture. &nbsp; &nbsp;
                <br>
                <h2>The benefits of colloidal oatmeal: a hearty meal for your skin!&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    <br></span>
                </h2>
                <p>Since everyone has been opting for a better, healthy life, there'd be hardly anyone who doesn't know
                    how beneficial oats are for our body! But for our skin? Now that's some magical madness we need to
                    ponder and learn more about.
                    <br>
                    <br>The nutritious breakfast meal for your body, oatmeal, proves to be quite nutritious for your
                    skin.&nbsp;<br></span>
                </p>
                </p>
                <h2>More power to your skin's shield&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></h2>
                <p>The skin's shield, the skin's barrier function, is a protective layer that keeps the environmental
                    aggressors at bay. The layer doesn't let the pathogens, free radicals, and all that gunk get to your
                    body and skin while keeping the water and moisture in. But the barrier is often compromised thanks
                    to UV exposure, weather, pollution, etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>The layer gets strengthened, and voila! The skin under the protection does not experience
                    dryness any longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span>
                </p>
                <h2>Doesn't let the drought wreck your skin&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></h2>
                <p><span>Colloidal oatmeal prevents transepidermal water loss (TEWL) by creating a barrier over the
                        skin's top layer. The barrier does not allow the essential and natural moisture to escape.
                        Studies point out that the water lost showed improvement after using colloidal oatmeal.<br>
                        <br>Summing up, the ingredient provides you hydrated and <a
                            href="https://beminimalist.co/blogs/skin-care/amino-acids-for-plump-and-healthy-skin"

                        itching and a calm and serene environment on your skin.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
                <h2><span>A soothing calm on your violent skin&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span></h2>
                <p>Research suggests that oatmeal has anti-inflammatory effects as it contains phenols and vitamin E,
                    meaning it prevents redness and calms down irritated skin and inflammation.<br>
                    <br>The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties combined give a wholesome relief from itching
                    associated with dry, irritated skin. Hence, people with eczema are often recommended colloidal
                    oatmeal.<br>
